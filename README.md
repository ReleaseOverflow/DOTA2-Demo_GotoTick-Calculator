# DOTA2-Demo_GotoTick-Calculator
Uses the "copy to clipboard" feature to capture and calculate the exact demo_gototick value for the currently copied time-scheme
GUI will fleshed out later on, maybe. But its working perfectly for what it was made for right now.


USE:

Open script, open Dota 2, play your desired demo using the playdemo command, navigate to just before your desired location, pause playback, click "copy to clipboard" in the demo pane, and then press the HOME key == your current saved location is now saved to your clipboard in the following format:  demo_gototick X     where X = the calculated time from your previous copied clipboard contents.  Close demo playback, open your demo again, open console, ctrl+v to paste and then enter == you're jumped back to the exact time for the time location originally copied moments before.
